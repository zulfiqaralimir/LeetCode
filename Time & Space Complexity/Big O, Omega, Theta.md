### Example: Sorting an Array

Let's consider sorting algorithms to see how their time complexities are expressed using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations.

#### Bubble Sort:

- **Algorithm**: Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until the array is sorted.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Big O (O)**: O(n^2) - In the worst case, where the array is reverse sorted, you would need to make n^2 comparisons and swaps.
  - **Omega (Ω)**: Ω(n) - In the best case, where the array is already sorted, you would only need to make n comparisons to confirm that it's sorted.
  - **Theta (θ)**: θ(n^2) - On average, you would need to make about n^2/2 comparisons and swaps, as Bubble Sort doesn't differentiate much in performance between best and worst cases.


- **Big O (O)**: Represents the worst-case scenario. For **Bubble Sort**, O(n^2) indicates that in the worst case (e.g., reverse sorted array), the time to sort the array grows quadratically as the number of elements (n) increases.

- **Omega (Ω)**: Represents the best-case scenario. For Bubble Sort, Ω(n) shows that in the best case (e.g., already sorted array), the time to sort the array grows linearly with the number of elements.

- **Theta (θ)**: Represents the average-case scenario, giving a tight bound on the time complexity. For Bubble Sort, θ(n^2) indicates that on average, the time to sort the array is quadratic, considering typical scenarios where the array is not perfectly sorted or reverse sorted.

These notations help us understand how different sorting algorithms perform under different conditions (best, worst, average cases) and how efficient they are as the size of the input array increases.
